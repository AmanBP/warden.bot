          You will need a permit to access Mbooni, which can be earned at the "Glorious Prospect" in LHS 1163 through work for Azimuth Biotech.
          Additionally, you can now obtain pre-engineered Heatsinks at certain locations. Just like the Modified Guardian Weapons, these are pay-per-module.
          You can find them at Tech Brokers on the Sirius megaships listed below.`)
